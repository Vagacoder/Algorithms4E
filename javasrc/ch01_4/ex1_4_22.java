/*
1.4.22 Binary search with only addition and subtraction. [Mihai Patrascu] 

Write a program that, given an array of N distinct int values in ascending order, 
determines whether a given integer is in the array. 

Note: You may use only additions and subtractions and a constant amount of extra 
memory. (Regular binary search does use division: mid = (low + high) / 2 )

Requirement: The running time of your program should be proportional to log N in 
the worst case.
