 * 4.4.35 Bitonic shortest path. Given an edge-weighted digraph, find a bitonic 
 * shortest path from s to every other vertex (if one exists). A path is bitonic 
 * if there is an intermediate vertex v such that the weights of the edges on the 
 * path from s to v are strictly increasing and the weights of the edges on the 
 * path from v to t are strictly decreasing. 
 * 
 * The path should be simple (no repeated vertices).
