 * 4.3.30 Euclidean weighted graphs. Modify your solution to Exercise 4.1.37 to 
 * create an API EuclideanEdgeWeightedGraph for graphs whose vertices are points 
 * in the plane, so that you can work with graphical representations.
 * 

 ? Serious problem, each edge has own weight, suggesting the distance between 
 ? 2 vertices. This ok for 2 vertices, but for 3 even more vertices, there is
 ? possiblity that we cannot satify all weights in a 2D plan.
